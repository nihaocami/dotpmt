# dotpmt

a super simple way to separate your prompts from your code.

## ‚ú® Why `dotpmt`?

When working with LLMs (like OpenAI, Claude, or open-source models), prompts often grow into long, structured text blocks ‚Äî but they're usually hardcoded as strings inside your codebase.

This quickly becomes messy, hard to maintain, and makes versioning prompts painful.

**`dotpmt` solves this by letting you:**

- Keep prompts in their own `.pmt` files
- Use variables like `{{input}}` for lightweight templating
- Treat prompts like real content ‚Äî editable, diffable, and readable

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install dotpmt
```

## üìÅ What is a .pmt file?

A .pmt file is just a plain text file with an optional templating syntax:

```
# summarize.pmt
Summarize the following:

{{input}}
```

You can store .pmt files anywhere in your project, commonly in a prompts/ folder.

## Usage

```typescript
import { loadPrompt } from "dotpmt";

const prompt = loadPrompt("prompts/summarize.pmt", {
  input: "YOUR LONG TEXT",
});

console.log(prompt);
```
